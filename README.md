## About

Chatrix is a messaging UI prototype for exploring a more focused, friendly chat experience. It brings conversations, contacts, groups, and profile controls into a full-screen interface with a compact mobile layout.

The project is currently a **front-end demo**. Conversations and profile edits are held in React state while the page is open; there is no server, account system, or persistent database yet.

## What you can do

- Browse, search, and filter the sample conversations.
- Open a conversation, send messages, and see their local send times.
- Add emoji and attach a file to a conversation.
- Create contact and group conversations in the current session.
- View contact or group details and edit the demo profile, including its photo.
- Explore the Calls, Communities, Archived, and Settings previews.
- Use a responsive desktop workspace or a mobile interface with floating navigation.
- See a GSAP startup animation, with reduced-motion preferences respected.

> **Prototype note:** Sending a message updates the local interface only. Messages, new conversations, and profile changes are not saved after a page reload or shared with other users.

## Why Chatrix?

Chatrix is a UI-focused project for practicing and demonstrating the details that make a messaging app feel usable: clear navigation, readable conversation lists, comfortable chat threads, responsive layouts, and small interaction cues. It also provides a foundation that can later be connected to authentication, a messaging API, and persistent storage.
